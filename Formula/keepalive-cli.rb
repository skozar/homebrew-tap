  def install
    # Tarball contains Contents/ from a PyInstaller --windowed .app bundle.
    # Homebrew unpacks and CDs into Contents/. Reconstruct the .app in libexec
    # so macOS identifies the process as "keepalive-cli" in Accessibility.
    app = libexec/"keepalive-cli.app"
    (app/"Contents").mkpath
    # Homebrew unpacks the tarball and CDs into the top-level dir (Contents/).
    # So CWD = staging/Contents/. Move everything from CWD into the .app.
    FileUtils.mv(Dir.children(Pathname.pwd), app/"Contents")

    # CLI symlink through .app
    # Note: codesign is done by `keepalive-cli setup` (runs outside Homebrew sandbox)
